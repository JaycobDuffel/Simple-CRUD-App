# Project Name: Simple CRUD App

## Description:

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that allows users to manage employee data. It serves as a demonstration of connecting a React frontend to a database and performing basic CRUD operations.

### Focus Points:

Database Setup: This project primarily focused on setting up the database and ensuring smooth interaction between the React frontend and the backend.
React App Functionality: The React app was developed to handle user input, send data to the backend for creation, and potentially display any retrieved data (depending on the implementation).

## Installation:

### Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone git@github.com:JaycobDuffel/Simple-CRUD-App.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

### Install
Bash
yarn install

## Running the Application:

### Single Terminal:

Bash
yarn start
This command will simultaneously start both the React frontend and the backend server, allowing you to interact with the application in a single terminal window.

### Multiple Terminals:

Frontend:

Bash
yarn start:react-app

Backend Server:

Bash
yarn start:server
This approach enables you to manage the frontend and backend processes separately in distinct terminal windows.
